=========================================================================

Our digital davar generator has but one dependency: python3

The design is centered around a stochastic[1] placement engine and
directed depth-first search, injected with a generous helping of phrases
of power[2].

The path finding makes heavy use of backtracking and features
intelligent[3] fallback in the event that the dark ones have entirely
blocked off a section of the honeycomb.

[1] translation: the target position for a particular unit is
    non-deterministic for implementation reasons

[2] at least it would be if we had managed to find any more!

[3] translation: after exhausting all possible moves, we fall back to
    flailing randomly



Hey, at least we got the simulation working :)

Stuff we ran out of time for:

* Including different orientations in the placement engine
* Subsituting power phrases in the final command string
* Optimising path finding for the case where the placement engine keeps
  choosing unreachable locations
* Having the placement engine always choose a reachable location
